# Blender Import Objects From Seperate File,
Import objects from a different file.

This is a Blender addon in which you can import objects from another file.

# Installation,
1. Download `Import Tools.zip` file.
2. In Blender goto: `User Preferences` > `Install from file` and selected the .zip.
3. Explore the new tab called `Import Tools` :)

# Useage,
To use the addon, head on over to `View 3D` > Import Tools.

1. The '`To create`' text area is where you can type the name of the object you wish to import.
2. The '`Create`' button imports the object from the file described '`3.`', with the name from '`1.`'.
3. The '`Import from`' file browser, allows you to choose the file you want to import the objects from.
4. '`Quick Add`' or '`QAdd`', is heavily under development, if the user creates a file named `app.txt` in the same directory as the file importing the objects, the user may have the entries on serperate lines in the file, the file may have comments using '`#`'

* `# This is a example!  `
* `Cobblestone  `
* `Chest:Doubble  `

# Notes,
1. ~~The file with the models must be named 'models.blend'.~~
2. ~~The file with the models must be in the same directory as the file importing them.~~
3. The '`Quick Add`' or '`QAdd`', is heavily under development. Permission Errors, often occur, Blender must be run with administrator permissions, to be honest, I'm not really sure.
