# Blender Import Objects From Seperate File,
Import objects from a different file.

This is a Blender addon in which you can import objects from another file.

# Installation,
1. Create a file in the same directory as this file, call it `models.blend`.
2. In `models.blend` add the objects you want.
3. Now in `main.blend`, click 'run script' in the code editor. A new tab should now appear in the `View 3D` menu.
4. Now type the name of the object you want to append to main.blend in the text area.
5. Click create... and voil√†! The object should now be imported.
